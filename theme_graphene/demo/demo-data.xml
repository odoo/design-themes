                    New Features Launched
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    To add to an already comprehensive set of Odoo
                    features, a website content management system (CMS
                    or WMS) has been developed and a beta release is
                    available from today, 31st January 2014.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="readable">
            <p>
                Odoo claims to be 'the Open Source software that makes
                building your company's website and selling your products
                online easy'. So how true is this statement?
            </p><p>
                "Odoo's latest launch will allow a business to go from
                zero to trading online quicker than ever before,” Stuart
                Mackintosh, MD of Open Source specialist and Odoo
                integration partner, OpusVL, explains. “The investment
                required to have a fully automated business system is
                dramatically reduced, enabling the small and medium
                enterprise to compete at a level of functionality and
                performance previously reserved for the big IT investors."
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "Finally, the leading edge is being brought to the masses.
                    It will now be the turn of the big players to catch up to
                    the superior technologies of the SME."
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                "This is another clever and highly disruptive move by
                Odoo,which will force other technology providers to
                take another look at the value they are providing to ensure
                that their 'solutions' can still compete."
            </p><p>
                "Odoo now competes on many fronts, with no real
                competition out there to knock them off the top spot.
                With the launch of their integrated CMS and Ecommerce
                systems,it only elevates their position as one of the leading
                lights in the open source revolution. It will be at least 5
                years before another ERP or CMS provider will be able to
                compete at this level due to the technology currently
                employed by most industry providers."
            </p>
            <h4>Adding to industry leading technology</h4>
            <p>
                Like many modern website editors, with Odoo you can edit
                content in-line, enabling you to see exactly what you are
                changing and ensure your changes suit the context.
            </p><p>
                However, unlike other web content management systems, it
                fully integrates into the back-end database. This means
                that when you edit a product description, image or price,
                it updates the product database in real time, providing a
                true self-service window into the business.
            </p><p>
                This provides a single source of data for your company and
                removes the need to create offline synchronisation between
                website and product database.
            </p><p>
                As it comes, there is a default website based on Bootstrap
                3, the latest industry standard for rapid development of
                multi-device websites backed by Twitter, so can be directly
                integrated with many web tools and works across all devices
                by default.
